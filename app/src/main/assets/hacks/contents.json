While terrorism still involves firepower, suicide bombers, and strategic targeting, we acknowledge the recent trend toward weaponizing vehicles as a low cost, low-tech method of indiscriminate attack.  Using vehicles as killing machines requires little preparation or training, and unlike firearms, they require no red tape to acquire. Adapting to terrorism trends involves expanding our level of awareness and preparedness to include practical considerations.  While research emphasizes the need for both preparation and flexibility in the aftermath of an act of terrorism,[ii] preparation on the front end is important as well. Mindful, intentional, practical steps designed to be proactive, not reactive, can protect you and your loved ones.  Here are some suggestions.",
